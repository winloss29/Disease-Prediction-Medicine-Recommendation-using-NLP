This project provides an
Intelligent Health Assistance System that
makes personalised medicine
recommendations using machine learning
and geolocation services. Users provide
information about their medical issues,
which uses a machine learning model to
produce precise medication
recommendations based on a large dataset.
Geolocation simultaneously detects nearby
medicinal stores for quick access. By
presenting both suggested prescriptions and
store information, the user-friendly
interface guarantees smooth interaction.
This project seeks to improve health
management by fusing geolocation and
machine learning, making it easier for
people seeking efficient medical solutions to
make educated decisions.
